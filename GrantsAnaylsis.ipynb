    "# CS418 - MoneyMapping In Chicago: A dive into Grants Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "By Sadika Almasri, Saja Bushara, Joshua Adereti, Freya Modi and Alisha Zaidi\n",
    "\n",
    "This project examines how loans and grants in Chicago are distributed across neighborhoods, focusing on whether that distribution is equitable. Using datasets from SBIF, NOF, and other city funding programs alongside demographic data, we aim to answer our guiding questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "Are loans/grants in Chicago distributed equitably across neighborhoods? and How do socioeconomic/demographic factors relate to that distribution? \n",
    "\n",
    "Because Chicago’s neighborhoods differ sharply by race, income, and investment history, our data helps reveal whether funding supports communities proportionately or if certain areas receive more benefits than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the proposal, our overall scope hasn’t changed, but we refined our dataset choices. We removed older datasets because newer 2023-2025 data includes the same indicators and is more relevant. We added demographic and ownership share datasets so we could directly compare funding patterns with neighborhood characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "For data preparation, all datasets were loaded from CSVs and cleaned to make them consistent. This included standardizing column names, converting currency strings into numeric values, and aligning community area identifiers across files. We created a **grant coverage metric (incentive amount ÷ total project cost) to measure what fraction of each project was funded by SBIF or NOF**. After that, we grouped the data by community area to calculate total funding, project counts, and average percentage coverage, and then merged these results with demographic indicators like income and racial composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "During exploratory data analysis, we reviewed dataset sizes, checked missing values, and summarized which neighborhoods appear most often in each grant program. We identified early patterns, like SBIF covering more neighborhoods than NOF and certain areas receiving higher total dollars and higher grant coverage percentages. We also ran simple correlations comparing grant coverage with demographic variables such as non-white household share and income level. These initial checks help us understand where disparities may exist and guide the direction of the deeper analysis."

    "\n",
    "What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "SBIF is clearly the more generous and widely used program. The average coverage (~60%) shows strong city participation in funding local business improvements.

    "\n",
    "Looking at the summary stats above, SBIF clearly shows up more often in the data than NOF. SBIF also tends to have higher grant coverage percentages overall, while NOF’s percentages are lower and more spread out. We haven't made claims about why yet, but the numbers themselves show the two programs function differently in terms of how much of the project they’re actually covering.\n",
    "\n",
    "These initial stats help set the baseline for understanding what normal coverage looks like in each program. When we start connecting grant coverage to neighborhood characteristics like income, demographics, or ownership patterns later, we’ll be able to tell whether a community is getting unusually high or low support compared to the typical SBIF or NOF project."

    "Looking at how many projects each neighborhood has above, SBIF clearly shows the widest reach. Neighborhoods like Near West Side, Portage Park, West Town, and Lincoln Square have anywhere from around 80 to over 160 SBIF projects, showing that the program is used across a huge range of communities. NOF is way smaller in volume, with its highest counts in places like South Lawndale, Grand Boulevard, and North Lawndale, where project numbers range from just a couple to about fifteen. Right away, this tells us the two programs operate at very different scales and in different parts of the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of dollars reflects the same pattern. SBIF neighborhoods like Near West Side, Portage Park, and West Town receive several million dollars each, whereas NOF’s highest totals appear in South Lawndale, North Lawndale, and Auburn Gresham, but at a smaller overall scale. SBIF is essentially the “big money, big footprint” program, while NOF is smaller but more concentrated in historically under-invested areas. When we look at average grant coverage by neighborhood, areas like Gage Park, Washington Park, East Side, Woodlawn, and Beverly show very high percentage coverage, often in the 70–90 percent range. This becomes important later when we compare grant coverage to demographics because it hints that some communities may be receiving a higher share of support per project even if they have fewer projects overall."

    "This dataset shows a strong racial pattern across neighborhoods. Burnside stands out as almost entirely Black, with 95% Black households, and Austin also shows a heavily Black population at 81%. White-majority neighborhoods appear on the opposite end, such as Dunning with 73% white households. Latino neighborhoods like Brighton Park (10% white households) and Belmont Cragin (18% white households) still show overwhelmingly non white populations. Overall, these numbers reveal a clear racial geography where Black and Latino communities cluster in distinct, lower-income areas, while white residents concentrate in higher-income zones.\n",

    "# Dataset 2: Ownership Shares\n",
    "\n",
    "These columns describe who owns homes in each area.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset shows who actually controls property in these same neighborhoods, and the alignment varies by community. Black neighborhoods have the strongest resident owner match: Burnside is 93% Black among owners and Austin has 72% Black homeowners, closely mirroring their household shares. But Latino neighborhoods reveal ownership gaps: Brighton Park, despite only 10% white households, has 16% white homeowners, and Archer Heights rises from 28% white households to 30% white owners. These mismatches suggest that in some neighborhoods (especially Latino ones ) the people living there are not always the ones benefiting from property based investments.\n",

    "\n",
    "These columns connect neighborhood income levels with grant program outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset shows income patterns follow race directly: East Garfield Park has an AMI of 0.30, Burnside 0.35, and Austin 0.40, while white majority Beverly sits far above the regional median at 1.20. When you look at grant coverage, SBIF consistently provides larger percentages in higher-income neighborhoods. For example, Beverly receives 73%, Ashburn 73%, and Avondale 63%, compared to lower income communities like Burnside (46%) and East Garfield Park (55%). NOF, however, behaves differently: Austin receives 62%, Brighton Park 64%, and Belmont Cragin 61%, while wealthier areas show no NOF activity at all. This dataset clearly shows SBIF reinforcing property wealth while NOF directs more support to under-resourced neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "These indicators are important in helping us assess whether lower income or majority non white neighborhoods receive higher or lower levels of financial support from city grant programs. Which we found some interesting results from in the next section. "

    "Now for the real findings...\n",
    "\n",
    "The SBIF correlations show that grant coverage has no meaningful relationship to neighborhood race or income. The numbers are essentially zero across the board: white household share (+0.001), Black household share (+0.045), Latino household share (–0.045), non-white household share (–0.001), and even income (AMI, +0.041) all sit far below the threshold of a real association. These tiny values mean SBIF provides roughly the same percentage of project cost coverage regardless of whether a neighborhood is white, Black, latino, low-income, or higher-income. In other words, the SBIF formula is statistically neutral! It does not increase or decrease grant percentage based on demographic or income characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What the NOF numbers show\n",
    "\n",
    "The NOF correlations show slightly more direction, but still weak patterns... Coverage tends to be somewhat higher in Latino neighborhoods, reflected in the positive correlation with Latino household share (+0.237) and with non white household share (+0.093). Meanwhile, coverage is slightly lower in whiter (–0.093) or Black-majority (–0.164) neighborhoods. Income has no real relationship to NOF coverage either, shown by the near zero AMI correlation (–0.003). Overall, these values indicate that NOF leans gently toward supporting Latino or mixed-race areas, but the relationships are weak and do not represent a strong/systematic policy pattern.\n"

    "# Summary of findings and next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The data shows that Chicago’s major grant programs are very consistent in how they cover project costs across different neighborhoods. Even in areas with dramatically different racial or income compositions, the share of project costs covered by grants stays within a similar range  between 50% and 70%. The correlation results confirm this: SBIF coverage has almost no relationship with race or income (so with correlations like white_hh_share +0.001, black_hh_share +0.045, latino_hh_share –0.045, and ami_shr +0.041), and NOF coverage also shows only very weak associations (such as latino_hh_share +0.237 and white_hh_share –0.093).\n",
    "\n",
    " This indicates that the grant formulas themselves are NOT favoring any specific racial group or income level in how much funding each approved project receives.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the bigger issue isn't the percentage covered, but it’s who actually gets to participate. Wealthier or more active neighborhoods show up far more often in the data as we showed by the counts of applications per neightborhood. They submit more applications and launch more qualifying projects. Neighborhoods on the South and West Sides, which experience the greatest economic hardship, appear less frequently not because grants are less generous there, but because fewer projects enter the pipeline in the first place. This points to barriers in participation, (so factors such as access, awareness, capacity, or resources) rather than unfair treatment in the grant itself. In short, Chicago’s grants are equitable in how much they fund, but not everyone has the same level of access to the process that unlocks those dollars.\n",

    "The next steps for this portion is creating a visualization which reflects this particular finding."
